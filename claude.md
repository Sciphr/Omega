Make sure we are always using the new supabase packages

make sure to look at what tables we have in supabase so we konw what is possible and what is needed to be added

give me the queries to add things to the tables if needed

never try to do 'simpler' or 'quick fixes' or 'temporary' fixes. always code like it's for the finished product

try to not use browser Alerts; always use in-appplication UI responses

Look at the database/COMPLETE-SCHEMA.md when doing ANY sql queries. Make sure you use it for context of what is already in the database, AND update this file when you make any changes to the database.
